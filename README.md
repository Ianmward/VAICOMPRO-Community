VAICOM PRO for DCS World

## Overview of the State of Play

On 31 OCT 2022 Hollywood_315 open sourced his awesome AI communications software for DCS Word. VAICOM PRO has been the launch pad for VR flyers in DCS to create a
immersive enviroment free from the constraints of keyboard or mouse controlled radio menus.

A group of community members have patched his work to make it compatable with DCS 2.8.XXXXX. This is a stand alone installer that will replace your previous version of Vaicom Pro.

We have tested this version and have not noticed any behaviours that were not present in the previous version. That said, there maybe issues. Please use the issues register here on github to report them.

The plan is to get Vaicom Pro running well with DCS 2.8 and then look where we can take it with lots of new modules coming to DCS World.

## Important Information

Please backup your previous installation also backup your current .vap profile from Voice Attack so you can move it across, this will save you a lot of work as it is compatable with this version.
Use of this software is at your risk, we acept no liability for stuffing up your Voice Attack installation, DCS World installation, Windows installation or any other action.
